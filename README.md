# Flexbox Layout 

This project is designed to help me develop and refine my CSS styling skills, specifically using Flexbox to create responsive and flexible layouts. As part of this project, I built a portfolio website (or small app layout), incorporating real-world design patterns and best practices to demonstrate my understanding of Flexbox. Through a series of mini-challenges, I gained hands-on experience with Flexbox's properties and functionalities, progressively improving my layout design skills.

**Key Objectives:**

Master Flexbox Basics: Understand key concepts such as flex containers, flex items, and the core properties like justify-content, align-items, flex-direction, and flex-wrap.

Responsive Design: Build flexible layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

Centering Content: Practice centering both horizontally and vertically using Flexbox, which is a common challenge in CSS design.

Advanced Techniques: Explore more advanced techniques like nested flex containers, aligning and distributing items dynamically, and creating complex grid-like structures with Flexbox.

**Conclusion**

By the end of this project, I will have a deeper understanding of Flexbox and its potential to create modern, responsive web layouts with minimal effort. This experience will also enhance my problem-solving skills when tackling layout challenges in future projects.
